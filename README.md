# Koa Rocks Project

> Koa.js powered minimalist Node.js http server framework

**It is in progress and _NOT_ ready for any development or production uses at the moment.**


Koa Rocks is not a Command Line(CLI) Tool to power your Node.js server side application. It is a
framework which includes well-structured code blocks and popular, well-maintained koa modules by
its core team members and community.

Koa Rocks works best with single page web application with any front end MVC javascript framework.
For example, [Ember.js](emberjs.com), [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), [Backbone.js](backbonejs.org), 
[React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/), etc. As the author of the **Koa Rocks**, I highly 
recommend **Ember.js** as your framework of choice. It is a drop in replacement server side logic 
for [Ember-Rocks](https://github.com/mattma/ember-rocks) CLI tool. See **Ember-Rocks**'s 
[Readme](https://github.com/mattma/ember-rocks/blob/master/README.md) file for more details.

Koa Rocks will maintain the natural flavor of koa framework. Source code should be very easy to
follow, and well documented with inline style.

Koa Rocks is one flavour of boilerplate API application structures. It is designed to solve one 
problem, which is Routing API. Server takes the request from client side, and return *JSON* back 
to the requester. This project is inspired from [Tj](https://github.com/tj)'s 
[Koa API Boilerplate](https://github.com/koajs/api-boilerplate). 

Special thanks to **Tj** and his team mates who make so many awesome libraries and frameworks 
to make my programming life so productive and efficient and **Tj** is my programming *hero*.
